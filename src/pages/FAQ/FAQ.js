  1. What is online learning like?
  </div>
  <div className="collapse-content"> 
    <p>For those who have never encountered online learning, the biggest question is often what it is actually like. The caveat, as you know, is that online learning comes in several forms. Therefore, this is your chance to explain that to people. Point out that there are different types of online courses and programs, and that they’ll have to decide which is best for them. Then, explain the types of courses you offer and how your online programs work to give them all the information they need.</p>

  2. Are you accredited or licensed by educational organizations?
  </div>
  <div className="collapse-content"> 
    <p>There isn’t always a need for licensing or accreditation for online courses. However, some programs do require it. Either way, people will usually ask what type of training or background you have, as well as any licensing that’s available if that’s relevant.

 3. What are the requirements to take the courses or sign up with your website?
  </div>
  <div className="collapse-content"> 
    <p>People will want to know how to get started. You can link them to the pages on your website that help them through that process, but you’ll also want to take the time to explain it to them here. If you have certain enrollment windows, for example, list those. If payment or deposits are required, explain that, as well. Make sure that people know exactly what they need to do to take online courses from you, no matter what those courses might be.</p>

 4. How long does each course take?
  </div>
  <div className="collapse-content"> 
    <p>Some online courses are just a few hours long, while others last a few months. Depending on the type of online learning that you offer, your courses may have their own variable lengths. Explain to people the types of courses that you have available and what the time frame is for each one. If you offer self-paced learning, this is another place to reiterate that and reassure people that you can help them learn on their own time. </p>
